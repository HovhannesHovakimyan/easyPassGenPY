## Task and requirements
Write a password generator in Python. Strong passwords have a mix of the following:

 - lowercase letters
 - uppercase letters
 - numbers
 - symbols
 - must start with a letter (uppercase or lowercase)
 - 8 character long

The passwords should be random. It should generate a new password every time the user asks for a new password.
I went a little further and chose a requirement for the password to start with a letter (uppercase or lowercase), as it will be easier to remeber.
Also, it should have 8-character length, again, for the user to remember it easier.

Additional future projects:
 - Create a simple calculator (Ruby or Python)
 - Build a weight conversion tool (Ruby or Python)
